# Riyadh’s metro station prediction

# Project Motivation  
The Riyadh metro organization is the governing body for the metro project in Riyadh, with such a new project some adjustment, but wouldn’t it be nice to have a map that displays the prediction for high traffic stations in advance to prepare in advance and avoid complications down the road?
By using data from the MTA which is the governing body for the subway system in NY, high traffic stations in NY could identified then extracting features of their locations (e.g.: near working area, school zone, housing area, tourist attraction, etc.…).  

# File Descriptions  
Proposal- Folder containing the project's proposal  
MVP- Folder containing the project's Minimum vaiable product  
Code_Slides_writeup- Folder containing the project's notebook (in code folder), PowerPoint presentation (in slides folder), and a summery (in writeup folder)


# Results Summery  
Based on the MTA Data, the most crowded stations in Riyadh's are most likly going to be stations near/in work places, right now the obvious stations are:
1. King Abdullah Financial Center Station
2. King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology

other stations are hard to pin down without in depth analysis.

Something intresting about the MTA top 10 stations is that almost none is near Universities, why is that?  
it could be because of students living on campus and that students schedule are not necessarily fixed like employees but does the same translate to Universities in KSA? only time can tell.
